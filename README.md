# Escher Interactive

This repository houses the code for [Escher-Interactive](http://escher-interactive.ucsd.edu), a project that builds off of [Escher](http://escher.github.io) to meet a specific set of design needs:
- inclusion of data plots on an Escher map
- boxes that appear when users mouse over elements on a map (Escher tooltips)

Escher Interactive was developed by the [Systems Biology Research Group](http://sbrg.ucsd.edu) at the University of California, San Diego.

Here, we discuss the high-level design of Escher Interactive.
